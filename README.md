## DL; DR

This is a tiny old-style text-based adventure game for learning Python.

## How to play

Just type `python3 game.py` in your console.  Enjoy!  (But, you need Japanese reading ability.)

## Required Python language level for reading the code

 - Basic I/O (i.e. `print` and `input`)
 - variable
 - `if` branch
 - `while` loop

That's all!
